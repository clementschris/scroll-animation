# scroll-animation

>> This is a simple CSS animation and JavaScript project that loads and animates in information as you scroll down a page, and animates  the information out as you scroll back up. A fun way of revealing information on a page rather than plan HTML and CSS.

>> The method of making this was taught by Brad Traversy on his 50 Projects in 50 Days course on Udemy and implemented and made by Chris Clements for this repository.
